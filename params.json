{"name":"Orgapp","tagline":"small project manager with relative tasks priorities","body":"# Orgapp\r\n\r\nOrgapp is a simple portable project management.\r\nThe goal is to have an app that can be used offline as well as online.\r\n\r\nTasks are created for projects, but they are prioritized relatively to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA project documentation is (for now, only) md files, tracked inside the repo.\r\n\r\nContent of the projects tasks will (soon) be stored as part of the project to.\r\n\r\nRepos can be git or mercurial repos, if they are not created previous to\r\nrunning the webui, they will be initialized.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n\r\n>   warning:: **Orgapp is still fresh and in development. Basic tests have been done, but not yet**\r\n>   **in production-like environment. Use at your own risks and after having done a lot of tests :)**\r\n\r\n## Get Orgapp\r\n\r\n* clone the repository to your desired path\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:abondis/Orgapp.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n* and enter it\r\n```\r\ncd Orgapp\r\n```\r\n\r\n* quickstart\r\n```\r\nmake start\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Prepare the environment\r\n\r\n* initialize the required submodules (only twitter-bootstrap)\r\n```\r\ngit submodule update --init\r\n```\r\n\r\n* enter the src folder\r\n```\r\ncd src\r\n```\r\n\r\n* and initialize a python virtualenv (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)\r\n```\r\nvirtualenv env\r\n. env/bin/activate\r\n```\r\n\r\n* install the python dependencies\r\n```\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n* configuration is done in two times\r\n  1. configure the app by itself (where to find the repositories, where to cache\r\n     the rendering, where to store the database)\r\n  2. setup authorized users with bottle-cork\r\n\r\n### Configure the app\r\n\r\n* orgapp will read the file config-\\*.ini in the config/ folder\r\n* it will use the first file it finds in the following\r\n  1. config-dev.ini\r\n  2. config-stage.ini\r\n  3. config-prod.ini\r\n\r\n* they have 3 sections:\r\n\r\n  * doc: specify where is the repository's documentation (path relative to the\r\n    repository's root)\r\n  * tasks: full path to the tasks database\r\n  * repos: full paths to the git and hg repositories\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configure users\r\n\r\n* needed to grant access to the edit functions of Orgapp\r\n`python config/create_cork_users.py`\r\n\r\n### Start Orgapp UI\r\n\r\n* Orgapp gives an interface to handle tasks and view projects. For that you\r\n  need to start its web interface, still from the src/ folder\r\n`python webui.py`\r\n\r\n* access to http://localhost:8080 , user: admin, password: test (cf\r\n  create_cork_users)\r\n\r\n## More to come\r\n\r\n* sync\r\n* how to install on android\r\n* tasks in files\r\n* push/pull\r\n* permit different markups\r\n* fixes :)\r\n* doc :)\r\n* unittest\r\n* cli\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n* Aur√©lien Bondis\r\n* Pierre Paul Lefebvre\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
